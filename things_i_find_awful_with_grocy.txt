things I can write an app with api calls (and maybe seperate storage) for:

- inserting new products that you already have is awful (inventory asks you what to do, enter product, have to select it again in inventory, no auto lookup for openfoodfacts, etc.)
	-> cli app helps, a lot
	-> cli app should have more things to query for products that are not food or not listed there

- there should be an option to have shortcut buttons "use up n items" like "use 1 - 2 - 4 slices of bread"

- I want medication stock tracking, with easy medication log
	- things sorted into container should be tracked as well

- the gui has no good way to shortcut things, like things you use up often for example
	- location shortcuts (i.e. fridge)
	- product category shortcuts
	- maybe have colors for different categories?

- there's no non-admin user support
	- non-admin users should only see their storage locations
	- functions listed sidebar should be configurable by user
	- would be nice if modules could be enabled/disabled in the admin settings rather than the config file

- "parent product" is a good idea but it is not well implemented:
	- you cannot list child products when you click on it (this might be even more useful in the purchase list, since you want to track the actual product & price)
	- it's a bit awful that you can select you want to have a quantity of parent and child product minimum



-! you can't change the best before date of your stock in any easy way
	- annoying thing: You didn't set a "best before after opening product", you notice it after marking product opened and can't set it otherwise
		- if you have this set, there should be an option to change the product to set "expires in x days when opened"

	=> fixed in master




not tested enough

- there seem to be a way to have partial quantities of a product, but not a good way to enter it or display it in the list

things requiring hackery:

- no support for multiple locations of the same product

- sqlite db... I want postgresql
